## 📘 About the Project

**Stop the Chain** is a small, minimalist web project inspired by the simplicity of sites like *NoHello.net*.
Its purpose is to provide a **single, clear message** encouraging people to respond to online hostility with calm kindness instead of escalating negativity.

The website displays a short, direct explanation of the “Stop the Chain” concept and offers examples of mindful, non-escalatory responses. The message is meant to be instantly understandable and shareable. Something you can send to someone in one click.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to:

* Provide a quick and simple resource people can share when they see someone engaging in negativity for attention or entertainment.
* Promote mindfulness and emotional maturity in online spaces.
* Interrupt cycles of hostility by offering a healthier alternative.
* Encourage reflection rather than reaction.

The site is intentionally short and straightforward so it can be passed around easily, just like NoHello.net.
